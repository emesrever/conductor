One goal of the project is evaluate the performance of the all-Python stack for data science by applying these tools to a real-world data set of considerable public interest.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@johngergely - contact with questions or to contribute.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
